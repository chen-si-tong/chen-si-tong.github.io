As for narrative structure, to represent the consistency in interaction design choices made by visualizations, we use the Filtering in interactivity. And because the data shows that interactive graphs do not include sufficient commentary for narrative purposes, we use introductory texts, and final summaries and syntheses in messaging.

As for visual narrative,We use sidebar to identify position, that can make readers realize where they are .

Advantages: 
* Analytical thinking is logical. we plot some interactive plots to show our idea.

Disadvantages: 

* There are some questions that we explore but we do not solve it, for example Monday is also a spotlight. The trend line of the fire incidents is almost same as the Sunday. However, this question does not belong to the categories that we want to explain. We just skip it.
From our experiences, we think the solutions that we get from the project are practical, but no further literature or news was found to verify our conclusions.

* Some parts of the project prefer to Exploratory data analysis (EDA). If we learn more mathematics and algorithm, we can build models by predictive analytics.
