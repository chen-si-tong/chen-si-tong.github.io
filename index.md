title: San Francisco - Fire Incidents Data Analysis
---
### Introduction
* This project aims to determine whether fire incidents have increased in the city of San Francisco. If a difference does exist, we hope to uncover possible explanations for it. Moreover, different socialeconomic factors are also going to be investigated to se if there is any kind of correlation between incidents and these factors.
* The following video summarizes the main idea behind our project:


### The Datasets
* Fire incidents dataset from the [offical website](https://datasf.org/opendata/) ; after cleaning, there is 27924 rows × 13 columns (year from 2003-2019)
* Fire inspections from the [offical website](https://datasf.org/opendata/) ; 85 kB, 347k rows, 64 variables 
* Awarded Degrees dataset directly from the USA's data api; 10 kB, 49k rows, 4 variables
* Median Earnings dataset directly from the USA's data api; 28 kB, 57k rows, 6 variables.

### Aim of The Project
* Identify issues.
* Find patterns.
* Back up our findings with social data - demographics.
* Provide viable solutions.
* Back up our finding with data.

### The Conclusion of Each Part
**Temporal Characteristics:**

* The number of fire incidents in the center part of the city is higher than others.
* Identifying pattern throughout the years.
* Apply data for the measures the state implemented to reduce the cases (e.g. number of inspections).

**Spatial Characteristics - Demographics :**

* Median income changes and how this affects the final outcome.
* Educational level of citizens and how this affects the final outcome.
* The fraction of‘Unintentional’(Ignition Cause) is the largest.

   
**Association Rules:**

* Statistical analysis in association rules.
* Proving that the most common and possible way to get a fire is by kitchen appliances.
