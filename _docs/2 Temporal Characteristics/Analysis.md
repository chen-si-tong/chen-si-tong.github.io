In order to understand better our data , we need to do more detailed analysis. We also need to identify patterns and try to provide usefull recommendations.

In the graph below we can see that the average number of cases per month are around 2400. We notice that the months with the most occurancies are January and July. The reason why those months have high amounts are propably because in January people tend to use their heating appliances and fireplaces more. July on the other hand is the month with the highest temperatures.
In this picture, we find that fire incidents in January and December are more frequent than in others. Why did the situation happen? We suspect that because the period from December to January is winter, and the weather in winter is cold, people use more heater than before.
Next pictures show that the occurrence of fires incidents varies by hour and day of the week.

It is important to figure out whether there are any patterns in week days and hours as well. In the visualization below , we can see the different patterns that take place during the different hours of every week day.
We can clearly see that the majority of incidents happen late in the evening. Sunday seem to the week day with the majority of cases.

Finally , we have to identify the main ignition causes and try to categorize them. 
‘Unintentional’ is the most important reason to cause fire. The city authorities have to apply measures to prevent human error. That can be achieved by providing educational courses both to schools and companies.
It can also encourage people to take first aid classes, in order to be able to help in case of emergency.
