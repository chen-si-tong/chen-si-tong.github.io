In order to understand better our data, we need to do more detailed analysis. We also put our attentions on the Northeast of city and to identify patterns and try to provide usefull recommendations.

In the chart below we can see the distribution of the cases between the year in the Northeast of San Francisco. 

As for the trend of year, we can find that there are the largest fire incidents from 2007 to 2013, and in this period, there is a decreasing trend in the number of fire incidents. However, the amount of fire incidents decreases sharply in 2014

We find the news to explain :

In this picture, we find that fire incidents in January and December are more frequent than in others. Why did the situation happen? We suspect that because the period from December to January is winter, and the weather in winter is cold, people use more heater than before.

We have already talked about the pattern on months. It is also important to figure out whether there are any patterns in week days and hours as well. In the visualization below, we can see the different patterns that take place during the different hours of every week day.
We can clearly see that the majority of incidents happen late in the evening. Sunday seem to the week day with the majority of cases.

Finally, we have to identify the main ignition causes and try to categorize them. 
‘Unintentional’ is the most important reason to cause fire. The city authorities have to apply measures to prevent human error. That can be achieved by providing educational courses both to schools and companies.
It can also encourage people to take first aid classes, in order to be able to help in case of emergency.
