Fire incidents are a growing concern for many cities, including San Francisco. Understanding the causes and patterns of these incidents is critical in developing strategies for prevention and mitigation. By analyzing past incidents and identifying high-risk areas, we can better allocate resources and take proactive measures to prevent future fires. Mitigating fire incidents not only saves lives and property but also contributes to a safer and more resilient community. Fire prevention is also an environmental concern since fires release toxic smoke and contribute to air pollution. In addition, fighting fires requires significant resources, including water and energy, which can strain already limited resources. By mitigating fire incidents, we can reduce the environmental impact of firefighting and make San Francisco a more sustainable and resilient city.

This map shows the temporal distribution of fire incidents in the city for each year. The map also reveals that the majority of occurancies take place in the center of the town. The suburbs also seem to be consistent throughout the years.

In the chart above we can see the distribution of the cases between the year in the Northeast of San Francisco. At first there was a rise in incidents with a peak in 2007, but then it started decreasing steadily. In 2013 we notice a sharp fall and then we keep on seeing a steady decrease of occurancies until 2020.
That could be due to the fact that the city authorities starting implementing measures to counter the rise of the incidents.
